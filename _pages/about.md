Hi! My name is **Hayden Outlaw** - I'm an Applied Mathematics PhD student at **North Carolina State University**, and I research **scientific computing, machine learning, and applied numerical analysis**. For some of my past work, check out the [repositories](/repositories) or [past work](/materials) tabs, with more available on my [Github](https://github.com/outlawhayden/) page.

In my free time I like to run, take photos, SCUBA dive, ski, study German, Spanish, and Philosophy, and see live music whenever I can. I'm incredibly passionate about using technology to better understand the things around us, improve the lives of others, and make the world a better place to live.

Have something interesting to share? Want to collaborate? I can be contacted via my email address embedded in the top left of the page. For formal information about my background, feel free to browse my [cv](/cv). This page is maintained sparingly - for critical/time sensitive information, please reach out directly.
