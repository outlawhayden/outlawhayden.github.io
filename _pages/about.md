Hi! My name is Hayden Outlaw - I'm a student, data scientist, and programmer at Tulane University in New Orleans, LA. I'm originally from Boulder, CO, but moved to Louisiana to pursue a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, and intend on pursuing a PhD after that.  I primarily focus on machine learning, statistical inference, and algorithmic equity. Most of my projects are available under the [repositories](/repositories) tab and are open source to all - although I'm always happy to field new proposals or questions through any of the contact methods listed here. 

In my free time, I play bass trombone for the [Tulane University Marching Band](http://tulanebands.org/tumb), work on computers for [WTUL 91.5](http://wtul.fm), study German, Spanish, Philosophy, dive, ski, and make fun digital art.
