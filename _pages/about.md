Hi! My name is Hayden Outlaw - I'm a student, data scientist, and programmer at Tulane University in New Orleans, LA. I'm originally from Boulder, CO, but moved to Louisiana to pursue a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, and intend on pursuing a PhD after that.  I primarily focus on machine learning, statistical inference, and high-powered computing. Some of my projects are available under the [repositories](/repositories), with more available on my [Github](https://github.com/outlawhayden/) profile - although I'm always happy to field new proposals or questions through any of the contact methods listed here. My most recent CV, as well as a download of my resume, are avialable under the [cv](/cv) tab. To see some of my academic works, check out the [publications & presentations](/materials) tab as well.

In my free time I like to run, SCUBA dive, ski, study German, Spanish, and Philosophy, and see live music whenever I can. If you made it this far, you should read these:
